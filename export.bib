	abstract = {"Quantum sensing" describes the use of a quantum system, quantum properties or quantum phenomena to perform a measurement of a physical quantity. Historical examples of quantum sensors include magnetometers based on superconducting quantum interference devices and atomic vapors, or atomic clocks. More recently, quantum sensing has become a distinct and rapidly growing branch of research within the area of quantum science and technology, with the most common platforms being spin qubits, trapped ions and flux qubits. The field is expected to provide new opportunities - especially with regard to high sensitivity and precision - in applied physics and other areas of science. In this review, we provide an introduction to the basic principles, methods and concepts of quantum sensing from the viewpoint of the interested experimentalist.},

	abstract = {With the re-definition of the International System of Units (SI) that occurred in October of 2018, there has recently been a great deal of attention on the development of atom-based sensors for metrology applications. In particular, great progress has been made in using Rydberg-atom based techniques for electric (E) field metrology. These Rydberg-atom based E-field sensors have made it possible to develop atom-based receivers and antennas, which potentially have many benefits over conventional technologies in detecting and receiving modulated signals. In this paper, we demonstrate the ``first'' multi-channel atom-based reception of both amplitude (AM) and frequency (FM) modulation signals. We demonstrate this by using two different atomic species in order to detect and receive AM and FM modulated signals in stereo. Also, in this paper we investigate the effect of Gaussian noise on the ability to receive AM/FM signals. These results illustrate the multi-band (or multi-channel) receiving capability of a atom-based receiver/antenna to produce high fidelity stereo reception from both AM and FM signals. This paper shows an interesting way of applying the relatively newer (and something esoteric) field of quantum-optics and atomic-physics to the century old topic of radio reception.},

In order to assess potential applications, detailed understanding of relevant figures of merit is necessary, particularly in relation to other, more mature, sensor technologies. Here we present a quantitative analysis of the Rydberg sensor's sensitivity to oscillating electric fields with frequencies between 1 kHz and 1 THz. Sensitivity is calculated using a combination of analytical and semi-classical Floquet models. Using these models, optimal sensitivity at arbitrary field frequency is determined. We validate the numeric Floquet model via experimental Rydberg sensor measurements over a range of 1-20 GHz. Using analytical models, we compare with two prominent electric field sensor technologies: electro-optic crystals and dipole antenna-coupled passive electronics.},

But an emerging class of quantum sensors that use Rydberg electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) to detect rf electric fields have yet to reach the SQL. In this work we prove that this discrepancy is due to fundamental limitations in the EIT probing mechanism. We derive the optimum sensitivity of a three-level quantum sensor based on EIT, or more generally coherent spectroscopy, and compare this to the SQL. We apply a minimal set of assumptions, while allowing strong probing fields, thermal broadening, and large optical depth. We derive the optimal laser intensities and optical depth, providing specific guidelines for sensitive operation under common experimental conditions. Clear boundaries of performance are established, revealing that ladder-EIT can not achieve the SQL due to unavoidable absorption loss. The results may be applied to any EIT-based quantum sensor, but we particularly emphasize our results' importance to the growing field of Rydberg quantum sensing.},

We demonstrate near photon-shot-noise limited readout of data encoded in amplitude-modulated 17 GHz microwaves, using an electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT) probing scheme. We measure a photon-shot-noise limited channel capacity of up to 8.2 Mbit/s and implement an 8-state phase-shift-keying digital communication protocol. The bandwidth of the EIT probing scheme is found to be limited by the available coupling laser power and the natural linewidth of the rubidium D2 transition.

	abstract = {We introduce and demonstrate an experimental method, optically-detected spin-echo (ODSE), to measure ground-state relaxation times of a rubidium (Rb) atomic vapor held in a glass cell with buffer-gas. The work is motivated by our studies on high-performance Rb atomic clocks, where both population and coherence relaxation times (T 1 and T 2, respectively) of the 'clock transition' (52S1/2 ) are relevant. Our ODSE method is inspired by classical nuclear magnetic resonance spin-echo method, combined with optical detection. In contrast to other existing methods, like continuous-wave double-resonance (CW-DR) and Ramsey-DR, principles of the ODSE method allow suppression of decoherence arising from the inhomogeneity of the static magnetic field across the vapor cell, thus enabling measurements of intrinsic relaxation rates, as properties of the cell alone. Our experimental result for the coherence relaxation time, specific for the clock transition, measured with the ODSE method is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction, and the ODSE results are validated by comparison to those obtained with Franzen, CW-DR and Ramsey-DR methods. The method is of interest for a wide variety of quantum optics experiments with optical signal readout.},

Microwave field induced AT splitting, fAT, is characterized by the distance of peak-to-peak of an EIT-AT spectrum. The fAT dependence on the microwave Rabi frequency, WMW, demonstrates two regions, the strong-coupling linear region, fAT ≈ ΩMW and the weak-coupling nonlinear region, fAT.≲ ΩMW. The fAT dependencies on the probe and coupling Rabi frequency are also investigated. Using small probe- and coupling-laser, the Rabi frequency is found to enlarge the linear regime and decrease the uncertainty of the microwave field measurements.

This system features different interactions that act on disparate length scales, from zero-range defect scattering of atomic excitations and finite-range dipole exchange processes to long-range Rydberg-state interactions, which span the entire array and can block multiple Rydberg excitations. Analyzing their interplay, we identify conditions that yield a nonlinear quantum mirror which coherently splits incident fields into correlated photon-pairs in a single transverse mode, while transmitting single photons unaffected. In particular, we find strong anti-bunching of the transmitted light with equal-time pair correlations that decrease exponentially with an increasing range of the Rydberg blockade. Such strong photon-photon interactions in the absence of photon losses open up promising avenues for the generation and manipulation of quantum light, and the exploration of many-body phenomena with interacting photons.},

The vacuum Rabi splitting appears when the probe field is strongly coupled with intracavity atoms. The cavity-assisted electromagnetically induced transparency with dual-peak profile is observed as a strong coupling laser is further introduced into the optical ring cavity. The optimal atomic density, resulting in an appropriate vacuum Rabi splitting interval and cavity-assisted electromagnetically induced transparency amplitude, is determined for the coupling effect criterion of the probe field and intracavity atoms. Finally, the cavity-assisted electromagnetically induced transparency is employed to accurately measure the microwave electric field strength, and a measurement sensitivity factor of about 2 is improved owing to an enhanced photon–atom interaction. This study is beneficial for the development of compact, broadband, and self-calibrating microwave receivers.},

This embedded atomic sensor is also capable of receiving modulated communications signals. In this configuration, the PPWG antenna serves two functions. First, the PPWG antenna acts as a source for a local oscillator (LO) field. The LO is required to use an atomic vapor cell (a glass cell containing a Rydberg atom vapor) as a Rydberg atom-based mixer, which detects the amplitude and phase of a second RF field incident from some remote location. The second function of the PPWG antenna is to capture the RF field arriving from a remote location and concentrate it at the location of the atomic vapor cell for detection. To demonstrate this, we show several examples of phase and amplitude measurements of an RF field with the embedded Rydberg-atom sensor. We also demonstrate the discrimination of the polarization of an RF field and the ability to receive phase-modulated carrier communications signals with this integrated atomic sensor. Embedding the atomic sensor in an antenna allows for the full characterization of a radio frequency field, in that the magnitude, phase, and polarization of an RF field can be measured with one compact integrated quantum-based sensor. Furthermore, the embedded sensor head allows one to easily vary the LO in order to maximize the ability to measure phase and amplitude of the field or modulated signal.},

A major key to their success have been dynamical decoupling protocols which enhance sensitivity to weak oscillating (AC) signals. Currently, those methods are limited to signal frequencies below a few MHz. Here we harness a quantum-optical effect, the Mollow triplet splitting of a strongly driven two-level system, to overcome this limitation. We microscopically understand this effect as a pulsed dynamical decoupling protocol and find that it enables sensitive detection of fields close to the driven transition. Employing a nitrogen-vacancy center, we detect GHz microwave fields with a signal strength (Rabi frequency) below the current detection limit, which is set by the center's spectral linewidth 1/T2∗1/T2∗. Pushing detection sensitivity to the much lower 1/T 2 limit, this scheme could enable various applications, most prominently coherent coupling to single phonons and microwave photons.},

Memory efficiencies above 50\% are required to be operating above the quantum no-cloning limit. Such high efficiencies have only been achieved in systems with photon sources tailored to the memory bandwidth.

The Cs metals are firstly obtained through the chemical reaction between cesium chloride and barium azide in a reservoir baseplate. Then, the Cs metals are evaporated to the preform through the microchannel plate and condensed on the inner glass surface of the preform. Lastly, the MEMS vapor cells are filled with buffer gas, sealed by anodic bonding, and mechanically diced into three dimensions: 5 mm × 5 mm × 1.2 mm, 4 mm × 4 mm × 1.2 mm, and 3 mm × 3 mm × 1.2 mm. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) linewidth of the coherent population trapping (CPT) signal of the MEMS vapor cells is found to be 4.33 kHz. The intrinsic linewidth is about 1638 Hz.

	abstract = {With their constantly increasing peak performance and memory capacity, modern supercomputers offer new perspectives on numerical studies of open many-body quantum systems. These systems are often modeled by using Markovian quantum master equations describing the evolution of the system density operators. In this paper, we address master equations of the Lindblad form, which are a popular theoretical tools in quantum optics, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and optomechanics. By using the generalized Gell–Mann matrices as a basis, any Lindblad equation can be transformed into a system of ordinary differential equations with real coefficients. Recently, we presented an implementation of the transformation with the computational complexity, scaling as O(N5 logN) for dense Lindbaldians and O(N3 logN) for sparse ones. However, infeasible memory costs remains a serious obstacle on the way to large models. Here, we present a parallel cluster-based implementation of the algorithm and demonstrate that it allows us to integrate a sparse Lindbladian model of the dimension N = 2000 and a dense random Lindbladian model of the dimension N = 200 by using 25 nodes with 64 GB RAM per node.},

	abstract = {This work reports on the application of a novel electric field-ionization setup for high-resolution laser spectroscopy measurements on bunched fast atomic beams in a collinear geometry. In combination with multi-step resonant excitation to Rydberg states using pulsed lasers, the field ionization technique demonstrates increased sensitivity for isotope separation and measurement of atomic parameters over previous non-resonant laser ionization methods. The setup was tested at the Collinear Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy experiment at ISOLDE-CERN to perform high-resolution measurements of transitions in the indium atom from the 5s25d2D5/2 and 5s25d2D3/2 states to 5s 2np 2P and 5s2nf2F Rydberg states, up to a principal quantum number of n= 72. The extracted Rydberg level energies were used to re-evaluate the ionization potential of the indium atom to be 46,670.107(4)cm-1. The nuclear magnetic dipole and nuclear electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constants and level isotope shifts of the 5s25d2D5/2 and 5s25d2D3/2 states were determined for 113 , 115In. The results are compared to calculations using relativistic coupled-cluster theory. A good agreement is found with the ionization potential and isotope shifts, while disagreement of hyperfine structure constants indicates an increased importance of electron correlations in these excited atomic states. With the aim of further increasing the detection sensitivity for measurements on exotic isotopes, a systematic study of the field-ionization arrangement implemented in the work was performed at the same time and an improved design was simulated and is presented. The improved design offers increased background suppression independent of the distance from field ionization to ion detection.},

	abstract = {Rydberg atoms have been used for measuring radio-frequency (RF) electric (E)-fields due to their strong dipole moments over the frequency range of 500 MHz-1 THz. For this, electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) within the Autler-Townes (AT) regime is used such that the detected E-field is proportional to AT splitting. However, for weak E-fields AT peak separation becomes unresolvable thus limiting the minimum detectable E-field. Here, we demonstrate using the Rydberg atoms as an RF mixer for weak E-field detection well below the AT regime with frequency discrimination better than 1 Hz resolution. A heterodyne detection scenario with two E-fields incident on a vapor cell filled with cesium atoms is used. One E-field at 19.626000 GHz drives the 34D5/2 → 35P3/2 Rydberg transition and acts as a local oscillator (LO) and a second signal E-field (Sig) of interest is at 19.626090 GHz. In the presence of the LO, the Rydberg atoms naturally down convert the Sig field to a 90 kHz intermediate frequency (IF) signal. This IF signal manifests as an oscillation in the probe laser intensity through the Rydberg vapor and is easily detected with a photodiode and lock-in amplifier. In the configuration used here, E-field strength down to ≈ 46 μV/m ± 2 μV/m were detected with a sensitivity of ≈ 79 μVm-1Hz-1/2. Furthermore, neighboring fields 0.1 Hz away and equal in strength to Sig could be discriminated without any leakage into the lock-in signal. For signals 1 Hz away and as high as +60 dB above Sig, leakage into the lock-in signal could be kept below -3 dB.},

	abstract = {Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is a phenomenon that can provide strong and robust interfacing between optical signals and quantum coherence of electronic spins. In its archetypical form, mainly explored with atomic media, it uses a (near-)homogeneous ensemble of three-level systems, in which two low-energy spin-1/2 levels are coupled to a common optically excited state. We investigate the implementation of EIT with c-axis divacancy color centers in silicon carbide. While this material has attractive properties for quantum device technologies with near-IR optics, implementing EIT is complicated by the inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions throughout the ensemble and the presence of multiple ground-state levels. These may lead to darkening of the ensemble upon resonant optical excitation. Here, we show that EIT can be established with high visibility also in this material platform upon careful design of the measurement geometry. Comparison of our experimental results with a model based on the Lindblad equations indicates that we can create coherences between different sets of two levels all-optically in these systems, with potential impact for RF-free quantum sensing applications. Our work provides an understanding of EIT in multi-level systems with significant inhomogeneities, and our considerations are valid for a wide array of defects in semiconductors.},

It can be used as susceptible atom-based microwave communication antennas where the carrier wave usually works exactly resonant to the transition between a pair of adjacent Rydberg states with large electric dipole moment. A technique of superheterodyne with a strong on-resonant local microwave oscillator is employed to induce considerable Autler-Townes splitting where the antennas has a highest dynamic response to another weak target signal microwave carrier. To further improve the sensitivity of atomic antenna in communication, we detune the carrier microwave frequency off resonance forming an asymmetrically optical splitting and fix the coupling laser frequency at the shoulder of the stronger one, and optimize the local field strength simultaneously. It gives a sensitivity of 12.50(04) \${\textbackslash}rm\{nVcm{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}cdot Hz{\textasciicircum}\{-1/2\}\}\$.

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

We discuss different possible regimes, depending on the relative importance of the various broadening mechanisms, and identify ways to optimize the absorption-reduction effect. The theory is compared to the results of a recent experiment (on a ladder-type system), using the Rb D2 line, with generally very good agreement. The maximum absorption reduction observed (64.4\%) appears to be mostly limited by the relatively large (-5 MHz) linewidth of the diode lasers used in our experiment.},

In this configuration, a strong far off-resonant field, denoted as a local oscillator (LO) field, acts as a gain shifting the Rydberg level to a high sensitivity region. An incident weak signal field with a few hundreds of kHz difference from the LO field is mixed with the LO field in Rydberg system to generate an intermediate frequency (IF) signal, which is read out by the Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (Rydberg-EIT) spectroscopy. Not like resonant EIT-AT spectra, we realize the electric field measurement of the signal frequency from 2 GHz to 5 GHz using a single Rydberg state. A minimum detectable filed strength is down to 2.31{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mu\$V/cm and a linear dynamic range is over 65{\textasciitilde}dB. The minimum detectable filed is comparable with a resonant microwave-dressed Rydberg heterodyne receiver using the same system, which is 1.45{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mu\$V/cm. We also show the system has an inherent polarization selectivity feature. Our method can provide a high sensitivity of electric field measurement and be extended to arbitrary frequency measurements.},

The RF field causes an energy splitting of the Rydberg states via the Autler-Townes effect and we detect the splitting via electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). In effect, alkali atoms placed in a vapor cell act like an RF-to-optical transducer, converting an RF E-field strength measurement to an optical frequency measurement. We demonstrate the broadband nature of this approach by showing that one small vapor cell can be used to measure E-field strengths over a wide range of frequencies: 1 GHz to 500 GHz. The technique is validated by comparing experimental data to both numerical simulations and far-field calculations for various frequencies.

With this method, and in spite of Doppler broadening, linewidths of 3.7 MHz FWHM, i.e., significantly below the intermediate-state natural linewidth, are reached. This allows resolving hyperfine splittings for Rydberg s states with n=20,...,24. With this method we are able to determine Rydberg state hyperfine splittings with an accuracy of approximately 100 kHz. Ultimately, our method allows accuracies of order 5 kHz to be reached. Furthermore, we present a direct measurement of hyperfine-resolved Rydberg-state Stark shifts. These results will be of great value for future experiments relying on excellent knowledge of Rydberg-state energies and polarizabilities. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

An atom-based, all-optical, laser-spectroscopic field sensing method is employed to measure electric fields in the cell. Here, the Stark effect of electric-field-sensitive rubidium Rydberg atoms is exploited to measure DC electric fields in the cell of \${\textbackslash}sim\$5 V/cm, with a relative uncertainty of 10\%. Measurement results are compared with DC field calculations, allowing us to quantify electric-field attenuation due to free surface charges inside the cell. We further measure the propagation of microwave fields into the cell, using Autler-Townes splitting of Rydberg levels as a field probe. Results are obtained for a range of microwave powers and polarization angles relative to the cell's ring electrodes. We compare the results with microwave-field calculations. Applications are discussed.},

Through this method, we nearly double the EIT amplitude without an increase in the width of the peak. A similar increase in amplitude without the repumping field is not possible through simple optimization. We also establish that one of the key limits to detection is the photon shot noise of the probe laser.

	abstract = {Rydberg atoms have been extensively utilized in microwave measurement with high sensitivity, which has great potential in the field of communication. In this study, we discuss the digital communication based on a Rydberg atomic receiver under simultaneously coupling by resonant and near detuning microwaves. In addition, we verify the feasibility of the Rydberg atom-based frequency division multiplexing (FDM) in microwave communication. We demonstrate the principle and performance of the atom-based FDM receiver by applying amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM), respectively. To demonstrate the actual communication performance at different data transfer rates, we consider monochromatic images as an example. The experimental results show that the maximum acceptable data transfer rate of both AM and FM is about 200 kbps, whereas their maximum bit error rates (BER) is less than 5\%. When compared with the traditional electronic receiver, this atomic receiver, which is compatible with FDM, has numerous advantages, such as small size, low power consumption, and high sensitivity. Furthermore, this receiver has a strong ability of anti-electromagnetic interference, and the signals transmitted do not interfere with each other in different channels.},

Enabled by a reduction in laser phase noise, our approach yields a significant improvement in coherence properties of individual qubits. We further show that this high-fidelity control extends to the multi-particle case by preparing a two-atom entangled state with a fidelity exceeding 0.97(3), and extending its lifetime with a two-atom dynamical decoupling protocol. These advances open up new prospects for scalable quantum simulation and quantum computation with neutral atoms.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},
